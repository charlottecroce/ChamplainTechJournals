## Part 1 - Active Recon (20 minutes)

The target is cupcake.shire.org at 10.0.5.23

What can you find out about the target?

```
└─$ sudo nmap -sS -sV 10.0.5.28
[sudo] password for champuser: 

Nmap scan report for 10.0.5.28
Host is up (0.0015s latency).
Not shown: 998 closed tcp ports (reset)

```

- Apache webserver on port 80 & 443
- webpage on both HTTP and HTTPS, looks like same webpage though
- access to cgi-bin/status

## Part 2 - Dealing with Targets and Scans (10 minutes)

- another way to get version info(this is more trustworthy than nmap): using 404 error message to check if there's publicly available information

- **Apache/2.2.15 (CentOS) Server at 10.0.5.28 Port 80**
- nmap OS version detection gave nothing useful


- Install nmaptocsv in virtual environment
```
sudo apt update
sudo python3 -m venv ~/.venv
source ~/.venv/bin/activate
sudo ~/.venv/bin/pip install nmaptocsv
