# Lab 3-3 DHCP Server in Packet Tracer

In this lab, you will configure a DHCP Server in Packet Tracer to assign IP's to laptops and workstations.

## I. Find and review your Subnet Table from Last Week's Lab

| VLAN | VLAN\_NAME | Hosts Needed | Network | Netmask | Router Address |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| 1 | Management | 250 | 10.16.0.0 | 255.255.255.0 | 10.16.0.1 |
| 100 | FacStaff | 200 | 10.16.1.0 | 255.255.255.0 | 10.16.1.1 |
| 110 | Student | 450 | 10.16.2.0 | 255.255.254.0 | 10.16.2.1 |
| 130 | StuLab1 | 35 | 10.16.12.0 | 255.255.255.192 | 10.16.12.1 |
| 140 | StuLab2 | 35 | 10.16.12.64 | 255.255.255.192 | 10.16.12.65 |
| 200 | StuWireless | 900 | 10.16.4.0 | /22 | 10.16.4.1 |
| 210 | FSWireless | 650 | 10.15.8.0 | /22 | 10.16.8.1 |

## II. Configure the DHCP Server

- Rename the generic server you enabled in the Lab Prep to DHCP-01
- Go to the Services tab and enable DHCP
- Change the Start Address of serverPool to 100 in the last octet
  - `serverPool` is the Default Pool and cannot be removed. 
  - You will use this pool for VLAN 1 Management
- Create a Pool for each of your FacStaff, Student, Lab1, and Lab2 VLANs
  - Start IP address -the first IP that you want to assign (in this case, 20 over network addr)

## III. Test your DHCP Server

Add a workstation directly to East-Core-Switch on VLAN1 (use FA0/4)
Workstation should be able to get an IP address from the DHCP server (look at IP Configuration) -you can also try ipconfig /renew from the command line

## IV. Configure DHCP Relay

- East-Core-Switch is the router for your VLANs. Remember - DHCP requests are broadcasts and cannot cross a router without help!
- To get DHCP broadcasts from your user VLANs (100, 110, 130, 140), you need to tell the router to forward them to your DHCP server.
```
interface vlan 100
ip helper-address 10.16.0.2

interface vlan 110
ip helper-address 10.16.0.2

interface vlan 130
ip helper-address 10.16.0.2

interface vlan 140
ip helper-address 10.16.0.2
```

## V. Configure Clients to use DHCP

Go into the configuration on your Admin, Student, and Lab Workstations, Laptops and change the Gateway from static to DHCP
Your devices should get DHCP addresses
All of your systems should be able to ping each other.
