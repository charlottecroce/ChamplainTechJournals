# Lab 6-1 NAT Configuration - Static NAT

## configure router interfaces
R1
```
interface fa0/0
ip address 10.0.0.1 255.0.0.0
no shutdown

interface serial 0/0/0
ip address 20.0.0.2 255.0.0.0
no shutdown
```
R0
```
interface fa0/0
ip address 30.0.0.1 255.0.0.0
no shutdown

interface serial 0/0/0
ip address 20.0.0.1 255.0.0.0
clock rate 64000
bandwidth 64
no shutdown
```

## configure routing
R1
```
ip route 30.0.0.0 255.0.0.0 20.0.0.1
```
R0
```
ip route 50.0.0.0 255.0.0.0 20.0.0.2
```

From the PC's, test connectivity by pinging the router address of 20.0.0.1 and 30.0.0.1

## Configure Static NAT on Router 1

R1: Define "Inside" and "Outside" on your NAT interfaces
```
interface fa0/0
ip nat inside
interface serial 0/0/0
ip nat outside
```

R1: Create the Static Rule:
```
ip nat inside source static 10.0.0.2 50.0.0.1
```
You should now be able to ping the web server using it's NAT address of 50.0.0.1
