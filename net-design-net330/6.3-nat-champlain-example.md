# Lab 6-3 NAT LAB 3- Champlain Example Lab

- Configure IP addressing/gateways on all PC's and Servers using the IP Subnet Table provided
- Configure PAT on CC Border Router so that Foster and Skiff PC's can ping the BT server.(45 POINTS)
  - Remember: Foster and Skiff are using private IP addresses (192.168....) - so they can use a shared public IP to access Internet services (such as the Burlington Telecom Server)
  - Must demonstrate that NAT is working by showing ip nat translation table.  You will need to ping the server from CC pc's to generate entries in the table
  - Hint: access lists can have more than one network in them - just enter a "access-list 1 permit..." line for each network that is allowed (Skiff and Foster)
  - Remember: make sure to use an IP from the Champlain Public Network as the PAT pool address
- Configure Static NAT on Border Router so that BT Server can access the Ireland Pub Web Server(15 POINTS)
  - You want Internet users to be able to access your internal Public web server - but it is using a private address
  - Pub Web Server is assigned a 192.168.7.0/24 address - but needs to be reached on a 219.93.144.0 address by BT server
