# Lab 1.1, Routing and DMZ

## Configuring rw01
- Secure your champuser default account by changing the password: `password123!`
- Add a new sudo user `charlotte:password123!` - `sudo usermod -aG sudo charlotte`
- Set your hostname: `sudo hostnamectl set-hostname rw01-charlotte`
- Make sure you have a static ip that matches the one in the IP assignments spreadsheet: use nmtui, set IP to `10.0.17.51/24` and gateway/DNS to `10.0.17.2` \

## fw01

default creds: `vyoz:Ch@mpla1n!22`

### set hostname
```
configure
set system host-name fw01-charlotte
commit
save 
```
Repeat exit until you get to a login prompt. Then you should see your new hostname, so go ahead and log in back to configure.

### configure interfaces
```
configure
set interfaces ethernet eth0 description SEC350-WAN
set interfaces ethernet eth1 description CHARLOTTE-DMZ
set interfaces ethernet eth2 description CHARLOTTE-LAN
set interfaces ethernet eth0 address 10.0.17.151/24
set interfaces ethernet eth1 address 172.16.50.2/29
set interfaces ethernet eth2 address 172.16.150.2/24
commit
save
```

### configure gateway & DNS
```
configure
set protocols static route 0.0.0.0/0 next-hop 10.0.17.2
set system name-server 10.0.17.2
commit
save
```

### Configuring NAT and DNS Forwarding
```
configure
set nat source rule 10 description "NAT FROM DMZ to WAN"
set nat source rule 10 outbound-interface eth0
set nat source rule 10 source address 172.16.50.0/29
set nat source rule 10 translation address masquerade
set service dns forwarding listen-address 172.16.50.2
set service dns forwarding allow-from 172.16.50.0/29
set service dns forwarding system
commit
save
```

log01 will be initially in the DMZ, later we will change this to a segmented network area


## on rw01, testing web service
- any address in your DMZ should route via fw01â€™s WAN interface. We do this with a static route on rw01
- anything addressed to the 172.16.50.0/29 network will go through the 10.0.17.151 router \
```
sudo ip route add 172.16.50.0/29 via 10.0.17.151
sudo systemctl restart NetworkManager
traceroute 172.16.50.3
```
