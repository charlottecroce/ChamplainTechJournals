# Lab 7.1 Assessment Prep 
Several systems in your current environment will be removed the day before the assessment, first thing in the morning.  These include:
- rw01
- fw01
- web01

```
You are on your own for the assessment ... open notes and internet, just no open neighbor.
This is really a test of your notes.
You will be getting new VM's.
Don't be late, as you will likely need the full time.
```

## fw01 configuration Backup
- **edge01**: (the new firewall will be very close in configuration requirements).
- You might also consult your the example week 4 configurations [here](../configs/fw01/fw01.config.week04.txt)

- Provide the raw commands necessary to reconstitute your firewall: (Remember, there may be some adjustments in IP addresses and rules for your internal systems.)
