# Conclusion

## Pros
- open source
- lightweight
- works on Linux, macOS, and Windows
## Cons
- stores current system state, which means it doesn't store historical data


## Overview

In conclusion, the OSQuery project demonstrates the potential of integrating OSQuery with Wazuh for enhanced security monitoring. OSQuery provides a powerful tool for querying and monitoring system data, while Wazuh offers robust endpoint detection and response capabilities. The integration of these tools allows for real-time event detection and analysis, offering significant benefits in terms of security visibility and incident response. However, considerations regarding complexity and resource requirements are important when implementing such a system. Overall, the integration of OSQuery with Wazuh presents a promising approach to strengthening corporate security infrastructure.
