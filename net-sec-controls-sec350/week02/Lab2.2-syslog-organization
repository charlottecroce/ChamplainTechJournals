# Lab 2.2 - Syslog Organization on log01

## setup mgmt01
- on LAN
- ip: 172.16.150.10
- DG & DNS: 172.16.150.2

## configure fw01 with the LAN
### NAT rules on fw01, to set NAT for LAN to WAN
```
set nat source rule 20 description "NAT FROM LAN to WAN"
set nat source rule 20 outbound-interface eth0
set nat source rule 20 source address 172.16.150.0/24
set nat source rule 20 translation address masquerade
```
### DNS forwarding from LAN to WAN
```
set service dns forwarding listen-address 172.16.150.2
set service dns forwarding allow-from 172.16.150.0/24
```
mgmt01 should now be able to ping google.com

## Install chrome remote desktop on mgmt01
- open chrome
- sign in with school email and turn on sync
- go to remotedesktop.google.com, install the app if you want
- on main host (laptop, go to `https://g.co/crd/headless`), download and install the package: 
  - there might be dependency issues, this command worked on my computer: `sudo apt install libutempter0 xbase-clients xserver-xorg-video-dummy xvfb`
  - `sudo dpkg -i google-chrome-stable_current_amd64`
- still on main host, click next and copy the command for the remote OS (in our case, debian)
- paste it in the remote terminal, and create a PIN
- at this point you should be able to access mgmt01 via chrome remote desktop, you might need to update CRD on mgmt01 first though, but we know how to do that ^
- IMPORTANT: log out of the remote computer before attempting to connect
