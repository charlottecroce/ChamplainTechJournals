# Lab 5.1 - Wazuf WAF
In this lab we are going to augment web01 by adding a web application firewall (WAF).  The wazuh agent should currently be able to forward apache error logs so a good deal of our work is done for us already.  We are then going to run malicious http requests against web01 to see how our WAF performs.
