Fill in the definition of each function.

You should NOT use any print() statements! Your functions should
return the value, not print it.

To test your program on Repl.it:
1. Run the program using the menu
2. In the console, call your functions now that they are defined.
3. If you change your code, you will need to rerun your program 
so the latest version of the function is defined in the console.

Extra Challenge: Can you define one of the functions 
in terms of another function? For instance can 
days_to_seconds make use of days_to_minutes?
