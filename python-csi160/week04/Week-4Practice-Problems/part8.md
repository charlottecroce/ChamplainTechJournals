# Statement

Chess rook moves horizontally or vertically. Given two different squares of the chessboard, determine whether a rook can go from the first square to the second one in a single move.  Assume there are no other pieces on the board.

The function receives four parameters from 1 to 8 each specifying 
the column and the row number, first two - for the first square, 
and the last two - for the second square. 
The function should return True if a rook can go from the first 
square to the second one in a single move or False otherwise.
