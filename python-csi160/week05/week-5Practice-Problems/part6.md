# Statement
Complete the function so that it 
returns a tuple with the first and last name.
There is only a single space in the full name.

Hint: The string methods `.find()`, `.split()` or `.index()` 
can be used to solve this problem

Important: You MUST return a tuple.  If your result is a list, 
convert it to a tuple before returning it.

# Example 
```
first_last_name("Johnny Depp")
```
Would return `("Johnny", "Depp")`
