# Statement

Complete the function.  For a given integer N, 
return a list that contains all the squares of 
positive integers where the square is less than 
or equal to N, in ascending order.

Hints: 
1. Start with an empty list.  
2. Use .append() to add new numbers to your list. 
3. A while loop is the simplest approach for most people. 
4. Consider writing psuedo-code first if it is helpful.
5. Your return statement should occur after the loop is 
finished and not be inside of the loop.

# Example

```
all_squares(50)
```

# Would return

```
[1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49]
```
