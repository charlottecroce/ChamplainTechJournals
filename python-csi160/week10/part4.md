# Word Frequency
Complete a function to count the number of times each word is used in a string.  Use the starter code to help you strip the punctuation from the string before analyzing the Word Frequency. Use a dictionary to store the frequency of each word.  Your data structure should look something like:

```
my_string = "The silly cat is the silly face."
word_frequency = {'the': 2, 'silly': 2, 'cat': 1, 'is': 1, 'face': 1}
```

The included starter code will help you strip all punctuation from a given text and convert to lower case.
