- on each machine, create a sudo account named deployer (have the same password for all of them)

## installing ansible
sudo apt install ansible sshpass python3-paramiko

Create /etc/sudoers.d/sys265 on all Linux systems.
ðŸ’£ Although it is not uncommon to update /etc/sudoers directly, it is far easier to script the addition of a file to /etc/sudoers.d.  The following line allows the deployer sudo user to elevate without a password.

As the deployer user on controller, create an RSA keypair with a passphrase protected private key and using ssh-copy-id, add deployer@controller's public key to the deployer accounts on ansible1 and ansible2.

`ssh-add -t 14400` - for 4 hours, you won't need to retype the key passphrase

ðŸ’¡ssh-agent allows you to decrypt your private key, in this case for 4 hours so that you only have to type your passphrase once every four hours. The eval command will test to see if ssh-agent is running, and if not, it will run it.

in deployer@controller home dir
 mkdir -p ansible/roles
   cd ansible/
   echo ansible1-charlotte >> inventory.txt
   echo ansible2-charlotte >> inventory.txt
   cat inventory.txt
  ansible all -m ping -i inventory.txt
